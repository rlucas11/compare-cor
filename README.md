# Shiny App to Compare Implied Stability from Different Models

This shiny app generates data from data-generating models that correspond to variations on the CLPM (including RI-CLPM, STARTS, and ARTS models). These can the be compared to real data to see whether the chosen model is plausible. 

## Using The App

There are two ways to use this app. First, you can go to [https://rlucas11.shinyapps.io/compare-cor/](https://rlucas11.shinyapps.io/compare-cor/) and try the app there. However, I only have a free account on shinyapps.io, so it is possible that the available time will be used up when you try it. 

The other way to use the app is to clone this repository and (after installing shiny) running the app locally using `shiny::runApp()` from the directory that holds the app and scripts.
